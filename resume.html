              <h3>Earth VR with Alexis</h3>
              <p>I created an immersive experience in Google Earth VR that takes users on a journey to explore mining sites around the world. As users navigate through open-pit mines in South America and coal fields in Asia, they witness the environmental destruction—deforestation, water pollution, and scarred landscapes—that results from these operations. I designed this experience to not only showcase the ecological damage but also highlight the impact on surrounding communities, aiming to raise awareness about the critical need for sustainable mining practices and environmental justice.</p>
